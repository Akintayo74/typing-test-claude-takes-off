# Claude Code Instructions

## About the Developer
- **Name:** Akintayo
- **Level:** Early intermediate frontend developer
- **Goal:** Learning AI-assisted development workflows

## Communication Style
- **Conversational and educational** - Explain decisions and trade-offs
- **No rigid frameworks** - Prefer hybrid conversational approach
- **Ask when uncertain** - Better to clarify than assume

## Proactive Problem Reporting
**Always tell the user when something is blocking or unclear.** Don't fill in gaps with assumptions.

Examples of when to speak up:
- Figma node only shows partial design → Ask for the parent frame
- Design specs are ambiguous → Ask for clarification before implementing
- Can't find expected files/patterns → Report the issue, don't guess
- Multiple valid approaches exist → Present options and ask for preference

**Template:** "I can see X, but I'm missing Y. Can you share Z so I can get this right?"

## Code Quality Expectations
- Write clean, readable code (early intermediate level)
- Avoid over-engineering
- Explain complex patterns when introducing them
- Focus on learning and understanding, not just getting it done

## Figma Workflow
When implementing designs from Figma:
1. Request complete frames (not individual elements) for full context
2. For responsive components, ask for all breakpoints upfront (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Validate assumptions before implementing - show what you see and confirm

## Project Context
- First time using Claude Code - prioritize learning the workflow
- Reference `PROJECT.md` for tech stack, architecture, and coding conventions
